There's a blind man sitting on his own, tryna find a way home
Searching for the next excuse not to carry on
Time goes by, day by day, but he'll never change
Compromised with all the problems he creates
For himself, just looking for ways to comprehend
Why waking up feels like entering hell without a friend
Deep his soul and mind will always find
That the way is to die
I've been waiting for your love for an eternity
The little child who soaks in tears is still here
Time went by, day by day, and he never changed
Compromised with all the problems he creates
For himself, just looking for ways to comprehend
Why waking up feels like entering hell without a friend
Deep his soul and mind will always find
That the way is to die
The way is to die
